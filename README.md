I followed his on YouTube playlist: [Neural Network from Scratch | Mathematics & Python Code](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ4osgQ7WN6PGnvt6tzLAVAEMsL3LBqpm).

In the first example, the neural network was built without any framework.  Just a python/numpy implementation of the formulas that he derived on his youtube videos.  Usually this is taught using tensorflow or pytorch.

The second case, uses the same neural network code, but gets help from tensorflow/keras to load in the NMIST dataset.  I found this to be very educational. Thank you!!

For plotting MNIST digits, I found [MrDataScience/tutorials](https://github.com/MrDataScience/tutorials/tree/master/Data/MNIST) tutorials helpful.
